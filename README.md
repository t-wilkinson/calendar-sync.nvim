# Calendary sync

- Calendar/Task List Selection: Allow users to choose which Google Calendar or task list they want to sync to.
- Don't add events if they are already there. Cache results. Have an option to force syncing. Should sync once a day.
- Customizable Time Blocks: Let users define custom time block durations (not just 1 hour) using syntax like "9:00-10:30 AM: Meeting".
- Caching: Cache Google Calendar/Tasks data locally to reduce API calls and improve performance for repeated syncing.
- Testing: Write unit tests to ensure each component of the script functions correctly and is resilient to changes.
